Here is a simple mapping between the given entity classes:

Customer : Many Orders (One-to-Many):

The "Customer" class has a foreign key referencing "Order" class using a "customerId" field.
Customer : 1 Shopping cart (One-to-One):

The "Customer" class has a foreign key referencing "ShoppingCart" class using a "cartId" field.
Order : 1 Customer (Many-to-One):

The "Order" class has a foreign key referencing "Customer" class using a "customerId" field.
Order : Many Products (One-to-Many):

The "Order" class has a list or collection of "Product" objects.
Please note that the actual mapping annotations like "@ManyToOne", "@OneToMany", and "@JoinColumn" need to be added to the entity classes to establish the database relationships. Additionally, the appropriate getters and setters for the fields should also be implemented in each class.

Give me Code and refactor my entity classes.

Also remember 1 Shopping Cart : 1 Customer
1 Shopping Cart : Many Products
Certainly! Here's a refactored version of the entity classes with the necessary code for the mappings you mentioned:

java
import javax.persistence.*;
import java.util.List;

@Entity
public class Customer {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Integer id;
    private String name;
    private String email;
    private String mobile;
    private String location;

    @OneToOne(mappedBy = "customer")
    private ShoppingCart shoppingCart;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "customer")
    private List<Order> orders;

    // Constructors, getters, and setters
}


@Entity
public class Order {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Integer id;
    private String orderDescription;
    @CreationTimestamp
    private String createdAt;
    @UpdateTimestamp
    private String updatedAt;

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "customer_id")
    private Customer customer;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "order")
    private List<Product> products;

    // Constructors, getters, and setters
}


@Entity
public class Product {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Integer id;
    private String productName;
    private Integer productQty;
    private Double productCost;

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "order_id")
    private Order order;

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "cart_id")
    private ShoppingCart shoppingCart;

    // Constructors, getters, and setters
}


@Entity
public class ShoppingCart {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Integer id;
    private Double cartAmount;
    private Integer cartQuantity;

    @OneToOne
    @JoinColumn(name = "customer_id")
    private Customer customer;

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "shoppingCart")
    private List<Product> products;

    // Constructors, getters, and setters
}
In this refactored code:

The Customer class has a one-to-one mapping with the ShoppingCart class.
The Customer class has a one-to-many mapping with the Order class.
The Order class has a many-to-one mapping with the Customer class.
The Order class has a one-to-many mapping with the Product class.
The Product class has a many-to-one mapping with the Order class.
The Product class has a many-to-one mapping with the ShoppingCart class.
The ShoppingCart class has a one Certainly! Here's the continuation of the code without repeating any information:
java
// ... previous code ...

@Entity
public class ShoppingCart {
    // ... previous code ...

    @OneToMany(mappedBy = "shoppingCart")
    private List<Product> products;

    // Constructors, getters, and setters
}
In this continuation:

The ShoppingCart class has a one-to-many mapping with the Product class.
Please note that the code assumes you have the necessary imports and dependencies for the annotations (javax.persistence, @Entity, @OneToOne, @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, @JoinColumn, etc.) and the required methods and constructors such as the default constructors, getters, and setters.
